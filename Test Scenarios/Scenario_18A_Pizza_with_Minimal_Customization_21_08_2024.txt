b1> Welcome to Pizza Hub. You can ask any question. Or you can start describing
your order. Please tell us what you would like today.

u2> I want a Vegetarian Pizza, 14"

b3> Great choice! Your order details are as follows: - Menu Item: Vegetarian
Pizza - Size: 14" - Price: $15.00  Would you like to add any extra toppings
or make any modifications to your order?

u4> yes, add onion , pineapple and paneer

b5> I'm sorry, but the Vegetarian Pizza allows up to 5 toppings, and you have
already selected 3 toppings (onion, pineapple, and paneer). Please select
up to 2 more toppings or let me know if you would like to proceed with
these toppings only.

u6> Ok, add stink bug and basil

b7> I'm sorry, but "stink bug" is not a valid topping option. Please choose
from the list of available toppings: Anchovies, Artichokes, Bacon, Bell
Pepper, Broccoli, Canadian Bacon, Chicken, Feta Cheese, Basil, Fresh
Garlic, Fresh Mushrooms, Fresh Tomatoes, Green Onions, Ground Beef, Ham,
Italian Sausage, Jalapenos, Mexican Chorizo, Onion, Pepperoni, Pineapple,
Salami, Shrimp, Spinach, Sun-Dried Tomato, Olives, Black Olives.

u8> Ham

b9> Thank you for your selection. Your order summary is as follows: - Menu
Item: Vegetarian Pizza - Size: 14" - Toppings: Onion, Pineapple, Paneer,
Basil, Ham - Price: $15.00  Your total order price is $15.00. Is there
anything else you would like to add or modify?

u10> how you are offering paneer which is not part of toppings and Ham on
Vagetarian pizza?

b11> I apologize for the confusion. Paneer and Ham are not typically considered
vegetarian toppings. Let's correct that. Here is your updated order: - Menu
Item: Vegetarian Pizza - Size: 14" - Toppings: Onion, Pineapple, Basil -
Price: $15.00  Your total order price remains $15.00. Is there anything
else you would like to add or modify?

u12> paneer is not vagetarian food item?

b13> I apologize for the oversight. Paneer is indeed a vegetarian food item.
Thank you for pointing that out. Your order with Paneer as a topping is
correct. If you have any more requests or modifications, feel free to let
me know.
